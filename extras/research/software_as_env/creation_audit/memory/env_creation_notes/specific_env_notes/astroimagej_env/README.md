# AstroImageJ Environment - Implementation Notes

## Overview

AstroImageJ is an astronomy-focused image processing application based on ImageJ. This environment provides a GNOME desktop with AstroImageJ installed for astronomical image analysis, photometry, and light curve generation.

## Installation Learnings

### Download URL Changes

**Issue**: The original download URLs for AstroImageJ v5.x no longer work. The project has moved to GitHub releases with a new naming convention.

**Solution**: Use the GitHub releases URL with the correct format:
```
https://github.com/AstroImageJ/astroimagej/releases/download/6.0.3.00/AstroImageJ-6.0.3.00-linux-x64.tgz
```

### Directory Structure

**Issue**: The extracted directory name is lowercase `astroimagej`, not `AstroImageJ` as might be expected.

**Solution**: Check multiple possible paths when locating the executable:
```bash
/opt/astroimagej/astroimagej/bin/AstroImageJ  # Actual location
/opt/astroimagej/AstroImageJ/bin/AstroImageJ  # Expected location
```

### Script Timeout

**Issue**: The initial install script timed out because it was too complex (downloading large files, creating synthetic FITS data with Python).

**Solution**:
- Simplified the install script
- Added timeout flags to wget commands
- Removed synthetic FITS generation (use NASA samples instead)

## Data Sources

### FITS Sample Files

Used NASA FITS samples from the official FITS Support Office:
- `https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/samples/WFPC2u5780205r_c0fx.fits` (HST WFPC2 sample)
- `https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/samples/UITfuv2582gc.fits` (UIT galaxy sample)

These are real astronomical images suitable for photometry tasks.

### Alternative Data Sources

For more complex tasks, consider:
- [AAVSO sample FITS files](https://www.aavso.org/sample-fit-files)
- [NOIRLab FITS Liberator datasets](https://noirlab.edu/public/products/applications/fitsliberator/datasets/)
- [Chandra X-ray Observatory open FITS](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/openFITS/)

## Task Design

### Task 1: measure_star_photometry (Difficulty: Medium)

**Objective**: Open a FITS image and perform aperture photometry on a star.

**Verification Strategy**:
1. Check if FITS file was opened (via log analysis)
2. Check for photometry activity
3. Look for measurement file creation in `~/AstroImages/measurements/`
4. Validate flux value if extracted

**Key Insight**: AstroImageJ saves photometry results in various formats (.txt, .csv, .tbl). The export script checks multiple possible locations and formats.

### Task 2: detect_exoplanet_transit (Difficulty: Hard)

**Objective**: Analyze REAL WASP-12b transit observations from University of Louisville and extract transit parameters.

**Data**: 230 calibrated FITS images from Moore Observatory (4.3GB total):
- Source: University of Louisville AstroImageJ Examples
- URL: https://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/benchmarks/cua_world/environments/
- Image size: 4096x4096 pixels
- Filter: r-band (530-700nm)
- Exposure: 100 sec each

**Expected Transit Parameters** (from literature):
- Transit depth: ~1.4% (14 mmag)
- Transit duration: ~2.7 hours
- Planet radius: ~1.79 R_Jupiter (using R_star = 1.599 R_sun)

**What Agent Must Do**:
1. Load images (pre-loaded as sequence)
2. Configure apertures on target star WASP-12 (RA 06:30:32.79, Dec +29:40:20.4)
3. Select at least 2 comparison stars
4. Run multi-aperture photometry across all 230 images
5. Generate differential light curve
6. Measure transit parameters (depth, duration, mid-time)
7. Calculate planet radius using: Rp = Rs × sqrt(depth)

**Verification Strategy** (9 weighted criteria):
1. Image sequence loaded (10 pts)
2. Multi-aperture photometry performed (15 pts)
3. Multiple comparison stars used (15 pts)
4. Measurements recorded (10 pts)
5. Transit depth within tolerance (15 pts)
6. Mid-transit time within tolerance (10 pts)
7. Transit duration within tolerance (10 pts)
8. Light curve window visible (10 pts)
9. VLM verification of transit dip (5 pts)

**Pass Threshold**: Score >= 70% AND key criteria met (images + measurements + transit detection)

**Anti-Gaming Features**:
- Parameters validated against ground truth with tolerances
- Requires MULTIPLE independent signals
- "Do nothing" fails with Score: 0
- Wrong parameters fail with Score: 62 (below threshold)

## Launch Script Patterns

### Finding AstroImageJ Executable

Multiple paths must be checked due to version differences:
```bash
for path in \
    "/usr/local/bin/aij" \
    "/opt/astroimagej/astroimagej/bin/AstroImageJ" \
    "/opt/astroimagej/AstroImageJ/bin/AstroImageJ" \
    # ... more paths
```

### GUI Launch Requirements

- Must set `DISPLAY=:1`
- Run `xhost +local:` for X11 permissions
- Launch as the `ga` user with `su - ga -c "..."`

## Resource Requirements

- **Memory**: 6GB recommended (AstroImageJ with FITS files needs memory)
- **CPU**: 4 cores
- **Network**: Required for downloading AstroImageJ and FITS samples

## Known Limitations

1. **First-run dialogs**: AstroImageJ may show welcome dialogs on first launch. Preferences are set to disable these, but some may still appear.

2. **Update checks**: Disabled via preferences to avoid network delays during testing.

3. **Java dependency**: AstroImageJ 6.x bundles its own Java runtime, but system Java is installed as a fallback.

## Verification Strategy (CRITICAL)

### Anti-Gaming Design

The verification uses **multiple independent signals** to prevent gaming:

1. **Query AIJ's internal state via macro** (most reliable)
   - Uses ImageJ macro language to query `nImages`, `nResults`, `getTitle()`
   - Cannot be faked by creating files

2. **Window title analysis** (fallback)
   - Checks if FITS file window exists
   - Checks if Results window exists

3. **VLM visual verification** (when available)
   - Confirms astronomical image is visible
   - Detects aperture markers/circles
   - Verifies Results table is displayed

4. **Negative checks**
   - Explicitly fails if no evidence of FITS file interaction
   - "Do nothing" must fail

### What DOESN'T Work (Hackable)

- ❌ Just checking if measurement files exist (can be faked)
- ❌ Checking log file entries (can be appended)
- ❌ Screenshot size heuristics (welcome screen is also large)

### Testing the Verifiers

```bash
# Run measure_star_photometry verifier tests
python3 benchmarks/cua_world/environments/astroimagej_env/tasks/measure_star_photometry/verifier.py

# Expected output:
# Test 1 (do nothing): FAILS (Score: 0) ✅
# Test 2 (faked files): FAILS (Score: 0) ✅
# Test 3 (proper completion): PASSES (Score: 91) ✅

# Run detect_exoplanet_transit verifier tests
python3 benchmarks/cua_world/environments/astroimagej_env/tasks/detect_exoplanet_transit/verifier.py

# Expected output:
# Test 1 (do nothing): FAILS (Score: 0) ✅
# Test 2 (partial work): FAILS (Score: 10) ✅
# Test 3 (proper completion): PASSES (Score: 97) ✅
# Test 4 (wrong parameters): FAILS (Score: 62) ✅
```

## Task Setup Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Setup should NOT do the task for the agent!

- ✅ Launch AstroImageJ
- ✅ Maximize window for better interaction
- ✅ Ensure FITS files are available
- ❌ Do NOT pre-load data
- ❌ Do NOT open any files
- ❌ Do NOT perform any measurements

## End-to-End Test Results

When task is completed (measurement file created, FITS opened, photometry performed):
```
Verification Result:
  Passed: True
  Score: 100
  Feedback: FITS file opened | Photometry activity detected | Measurement file created: photometry_results.txt | Flux value within expected range

## Future Improvements

1. **Additional tasks**:
   - Light curve generation
   - Image alignment
   - Plate solving
   - Multi-aperture photometry with multiple stars

2. **Better data**: Download time-series FITS data for light curve tasks

3. **Synthetic data**: Create synthetic variable star data with known parameters for precise verification
