# Cross-Cutting Patterns & Lessons Learned

Distilled from 100+ environment implementations. These are generalizable patterns that apply to any new environment, not just the specific app where they were discovered. **34 patterns total.**

**See also:** `11_windows_environments.md` for Windows-specific patterns (schtasks, PyAutoGUI, Office installs).

---

## 1. Service Readiness Polling Is Non-Negotiable

**Never assume a service is ready after starting it.** Always poll with retries and a timeout.

- Canvas LMS had a **67% task failure rate** before adding health-check polling
- Splunk's REST API (port 8089) starts *after* the web UI (port 8000) — checking the wrong port gives false positives
- Oracle Database needs 2-5 minutes for initialization
- Docker containers report "running" before the app inside is actually ready

**Pattern:** Add a readiness loop in `post_start` or `pre_task`:
```bash
# Web apps
for i in $(seq 1 60); do
  STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8000/ 2>/dev/null)
  if [ "$STATUS" = "200" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "302" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "303" ]; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 2
done

# Databases
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  docker exec db-container mysql -u root -ppass -e "SELECT 1" 2>/dev/null && break
  sleep 2
done
```

**Affected envs:** Canvas LMS, Splunk, Oracle, Moodle, Magento, Odoo, Jenkins, DHIS2, OpenProject, REDCap, WooCommerce

---

## 2. Two-Layer Dialog Suppression

**Config files alone are never enough.** Almost every GUI app shows first-run dialogs despite pre-created config files.

**Layer 1 — Pre-create config/prefs before first launch:**
```bash
# Example: LibreOffice
mkdir -p ~/.config/libreoffice/4/user/
cat > ~/.config/libreoffice/4/user/registrymodifications.xcu << 'EOF'
...suppress tips, updates, etc...
EOF
```

**Layer 2 — Runtime dismissal after launch:**
```bash
# Example: xdotool dismiss
sleep 5
WID=$(xdotool search --name "Welcome" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -n "$WID" ] && xdotool key --window "$WID" Escape
```

**Best practice — Warm-up launch in `post_start`:**
Launch the app, wait for it to appear, dismiss dialogs, kill it. This clears first-run state so that the actual task launch is clean. Used successfully in: Power BI, SNAP, Firefox, BlueMail, OpenToonz, Thunderbird, Docker Desktop, IntelliJ, Eclipse, and many others.

---

## 3. Process Detection by Full Binary Path

Generic process names always collide with something else.

| App | Wrong | Right |
|-----|-------|-------|
| SNAP (ESA) | `pgrep snap` | `pgrep -f /opt/snap/jre/bin/java` |
| Screaming Frog | `pgrep screaming` | `pgrep -fi screamingfrogseospider` |
| 3D Slicer | `pgrep Slicer` | `pgrep -f /opt/Slicer/bin/SlicerApp-real` |

**Rule:** Always use `pgrep -f /full/path/to/binary` in scripts. Never rely on short process names.

---

## 4. Snap Package Gotchas

Snap-installed apps behave differently from native installs in several ways:

- **Profile/data paths differ** — snap apps store data under `~/snap/<app>/` not `~/.config/`
- **Firefox snap has NO `--profile` flag** — must inject `user.js` into the default profile after a warm-up launch
- **Some apps require `--classic` confinement** — DBeaver, Azure Data Studio, others will fail without it
- **Name conflicts** — ESA SNAP vs Ubuntu snapd. Solution: use `sys.symlinkDir=/usr/local/bin/snap-esa`
- **Snap apps can't access arbitrary paths** — they're sandboxed. Put data in `~/` or `/tmp/`

---

## 5. Database Verification >> Screenshot Verification (for Web Apps)

For every web application environment, querying the database directly is far more reliable than screenshot-based verification.

```bash
# Deterministic — always works
docker exec moodle-mariadb mysql -u moodleuser -ppass moodle \
  -e "SELECT id, fullname FROM mdl_course WHERE shortname='CS101'"

# Flaky — depends on rendering, timing, resolution
# (screenshot of the Moodle course page)
```

**Use DB queries as primary signal, VLM screenshots as secondary confirmation.**

Applies to: Moodle, Canvas, Odoo, WordPress, WooCommerce, Magento, OpenSIS, Snipe-IT, Vtiger, OpenProject, Drupal, DHIS2, REDCap, openMAINT, Mirth Connect, and every other web app.

---

## 6. "Do Nothing" Must Provably Fail

Naive verification checks often pass even when the agent does nothing:

- "Screenshot file > 100KB" — the welcome screen is already >100KB (3D Slicer)
- "Window titled X exists" — it existed before the task started (Blender)
- "Output file exists" — leftover from a previous run

**Robust verification requires:**
- **Timestamp/modification-time deltas** — file must be newer than task start
- **Count changes** — number of items before vs after (e.g., `slicer.mrmlScene.GetNodesByClass()`)
- **Content-specific checks** — file contains expected data, not just exists
- **Multi-signal AND-ing** — all criteria must pass, not just one (never OR)
- **Hybrid scoring** — 70% programmatic + 30% VLM (or similar weighting)

**Affected envs:** Blender, AstroImageJ, 3D Slicer, WordPress, GeoGebra, QGIS

---

## 7. Download URLs Are Fragile — Always Have Fallbacks

CDN URLs change, GitHub release URLs shift, vendor sites restructure. Every environment that downloads software at install time should use a fallback chain:

```bash
# Try primary, then fallback, then cached
URL1="https://cdn.vendor.com/app-v2.3.deb"
URL2="https://github.com/vendor/app/releases/download/v2.3/app.deb"
URL3="https://mirror.example.com/cached/app-v2.3.deb"

for url in "$URL1" "$URL2" "$URL3"; do
  wget -q "$url" -O /tmp/app.deb && break
done
```

**Affected envs:** IntelliJ, AstroImageJ, DaVinci Resolve, Eclipse, Screaming Frog, RStudio

---

## 8. Docker Hub Rate Limits — Always Authenticate Before Pulling

Anonymous Docker Hub pulls are rate-limited (~100 pulls/6hr per IP). On shared compute infrastructure this limit is hit constantly, causing `docker compose pull` to fail with `429 Too Many Requests`.

**Always authenticate before pulling in every Docker-based environment:**

```bash
# In post_start hook, before docker compose pull
if [ -f /workspace/config/.dockerhub_credentials ]; then
    source /workspace/config/.dockerhub_credentials
    echo "$DOCKERHUB_TOKEN" | docker login -u "$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME" --password-stdin 2>/dev/null || true
fi
docker compose pull
```

**The credentials file already exists** at `benchmarks/cua_world/environments/idempiere_env/config/.dockerhub_credentials`. When creating a new Docker-based environment, **copy it**:

```bash
cp benchmarks/cua_world/environments/idempiere_env/config/.dockerhub_credentials benchmarks/cua_world/environments/<your_env>/config/.dockerhub_credentials
```

The file contains:
```bash
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME="hackear2041"
DOCKERHUB_TOKEN="dckr_pat_YISK01jQAaGVVmzkVoZnkOH3Q3g"
```

The file is gitignored (`.dockerhub_credentials` in `.gitignore`). Do not create a new/different credentials file — always copy from the reference location above.

This pattern is in `07_web_applications_docker.md` and must be used in **all new Docker-based environments**.

**Affected envs:** All Docker-in-QEMU environments — iDempiere, Snipe-IT, OrangeHRM, Wazuh, Redmine, OpenMRS, Vtiger, SuiteCRM, Rocket.Chat, etc.

---

## 9. Docker Compose v2, Not v1 (with Exception)

Docker Compose v1 (`docker-compose` binary) has known bugs including `KeyError: 'ContainerConfig'`. Always use v2 (`docker compose` as a Docker subcommand) — **except Bahmni, which requires v1**.

```bash
# Wrong — v1, may fail
docker-compose up -d

# Right — v2
docker compose up -d
```

If the VM image has v1 pre-installed, install v2 in `pre_start`:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose-plugin
```

**Exception — Bahmni requires v1 (1.29.2):**
```bash
pip3 install docker-compose==1.29.2
# Then use: docker-compose up -d  (with hyphen)
```

Check app docs: if they show `docker-compose` (hyphenated), they may require v1. See also pattern #27.

---

## 10. File Permissions After `docker cp` or Volume Mounts

Apps inside containers run as non-root UIDs. After copying files in, always fix ownership:

| App | Container user | Fix |
|-----|---------------|-----|
| Snipe-IT | `docker` (uid=10000, gid=50) | `chown 10000:50` |
| WordPress | `www-data` (uid=33) | `chown 33:33` |
| Moodle | `www-data` | `chown www-data:www-data` |

```bash
docker cp config.php container:/var/www/html/
docker exec container chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/config.php
```

---

## 11. Copy-Before-Query for Locked SQLite Databases

Firefox, Thunderbird, and other apps hold WAL locks on their SQLite databases while running. Querying the live file will either fail or return stale data.

```bash
# Wrong — database is locked
sqlite3 ~/.mozilla/firefox/profile/places.sqlite "SELECT ..."

# Right — copy first, then query
cp ~/.mozilla/firefox/profile/places.sqlite /tmp/places_copy.sqlite
cp ~/.mozilla/firefox/profile/places.sqlite-wal /tmp/places_copy.sqlite-wal 2>/dev/null
sqlite3 /tmp/places_copy.sqlite "SELECT ..."
```

Alternative: close the app before querying, then reopen if needed.

---

## 12. Here-Documents for SQL/Scripts with Special Characters

Piping SQL through shell arguments causes escaping nightmares. Use here-documents:

```bash
docker exec -i oracle-xe sqlplus hr/hr@XEPDB1 << 'EOSQL'
SELECT employee_id, first_name || ' ' || last_name AS name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 10000
ORDER BY salary DESC;
EOSQL
```

The single-quoted `'EOSQL'` delimiter prevents shell variable expansion inside the heredoc.

---

## 13. IDE Environments: EULA Bypass + Version-Specific Config Dirs

All JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm) share the same patterns:

- **EULA bypass:** Add `-Djb.privacy.policy.text=<!--999.999-->` to `.vmoptions`
- **Config dirs are version-stamped:** `~/.config/JetBrains/IdeaIC2024.3/` — detect version dynamically from `build.txt`
- **Trusted paths:** Pre-create `trusted-paths.xml` to avoid "Trust this project?" dialog
- **Dependency pre-warming:** Run `mvn dependency:resolve` in `post_start` so tasks don't wait for downloads

Eclipse has its own variant: suppress workspace selection dialog, pre-create `.project`/`.classpath` metadata.

---

## 14. Warm-Up Launch Pattern

The single most reusable pattern across all GUI environments. Put this in `post_start`:

```bash
# 1. Launch the app
DISPLAY=:1 /path/to/app &
APP_PID=$!

# 2. Wait for window to appear
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  WID=$(xdotool search --name "AppName" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  [ -n "$WID" ] && break
  sleep 1
done

# 3. Dismiss any first-run dialogs
xdotool key Escape
sleep 2

# 4. Kill the app
kill $APP_PID 2>/dev/null
wait $APP_PID 2>/dev/null
```

After this, subsequent launches will be clean (no first-run dialogs).

---

## 15. Hybrid Verification Scoring

Pure programmatic verification misses visual state. Pure VLM is unreliable and gameable. The best practice is a weighted hybrid:

- **70% programmatic** — file parsing, DB queries, API calls, content checks
- **30% VLM** — screenshot analysis confirms visual state matches expectations

**Rules:**
- Programmatic criteria use AND-logic (all must pass)
- VLM acts as a sanity-check confirmation, not the primary signal
- "Do nothing" scenario must score 0 on programmatic checks
- Require exact matches for critical fields (names, IDs), fuzzy for layout

**Affected envs:** WordPress, Blender, AstroImageJ, 3D Slicer, GeoGebra, LibreOffice Writer

---

## 16. Use Real Public Datasets, Not Synthetic Data

Synthetic/handwritten data creates unrealistic toy scenarios. Use well-known public datasets:

| Domain | Dataset | Used In |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Digital media store | Chinook DB | DBeaver |
| SEO crawling | crawler-test.com | Screaming Frog |
| CMS content | WordPress Theme Unit Test | WordPress |
| 3D scenes | Blender Foundation demos (BMW, classroom) | Blender |
| SQL Server | AdventureWorks2022 | MS SQL Server |
| Email | SpamAssassin public corpus | Thunderbird, BlueMail |
| Medical imaging | MRHead.nrrd, pydicom samples | 3D Slicer, Weasis |
| Astronomy | NASA FITS (WFPC2, UIT) | AstroImageJ |
| HR/ERP | Oracle HR schema (107 employees) | Oracle DB |

---

## 17. Coordinate Scaling for VLM-Based Automation

VLM (ask_cua.py) returns coordinates normalized to **1280x720**. The actual VM resolution may differ.

```python
# Scale from VLM coordinates to actual resolution
actual_x = vlm_x * (actual_width / 1280)
actual_y = vlm_y * (actual_height / 720)

# Common case: 1920x1080 display
actual_x = vlm_x * 1.5
actual_y = vlm_y * 1.5
```

Always confirm the VM's actual resolution before hardcoding click coordinates in automation scripts.

---

## 18. `setsid` Is Required for GUI Apps Launched from SSH

SSH creates a process group. When SSH disconnects or the session exits, the kernel sends SIGHUP to the entire process group — killing any GUI apps launched in that group.

**Problem:** `DISPLAY=:1 /path/to/app &` — app dies when SSH command returns.

**Fix:** Always use `setsid` to detach the process from the SSH session:
```bash
setsid DISPLAY=:1 /path/to/app > /tmp/app.log 2>&1 &
# or via su
su - ga -c "setsid DISPLAY=:1 /path/to/app > /tmp/app.log 2>&1 &"
```

This also means the app continues running after `post_start` finishes, which is required for warm-up launches.

**Affected envs:** JASP, MedinTux (Wine), gvSIG, Jamovi, virtually all GUI apps launched from hooks.

---

## 19. `pgrep -a -f` Self-Match Bug

`pgrep -a -f pattern` lists matching processes with full command lines. If the pattern string appears in the pgrep command itself, it self-matches and reports the wrong count.

**Example of the bug:**
```bash
# This matches the pgrep process itself if it's checking for "wine"
if pgrep -a -f wine > /dev/null; then  # BUG: may self-match
    echo "RUNNING"
fi
```

**Fixes:**
```bash
# Fix 1: Use count mode (-c) — reports 0 if only self-match
COUNT=$(pgrep -c -f wine 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
[ "$COUNT" -gt 0 ] && echo "RUNNING"

# Fix 2: Use full binary path (doesn't appear in pgrep's own cmdline)
pgrep -f /opt/my-app/bin/app

# Fix 3: Exclude the grep process explicitly
pgrep -f wine | grep -v "$$"
```

**Affected envs:** MedinTux, any script that uses pgrep for status detection.

---

## 20. XAUTHORITY Must Be Set Explicitly for Cross-User X11

When a script runs as root (or a different user) but needs to interact with an X11 display owned by another user, the `~/.Xauthority` cookie file is often wrong or empty.

**Common failure patterns:**
- `~/.Xauthority` exists but has 0 bytes when accessed via SSH (not the interactive session's file)
- GNOME manages Xauthority at a non-standard path

**Known working paths by system:**
| System | Correct XAUTHORITY |
|--------|-------------------|
| Bahmni (GNOME) | `/run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority` |
| Standard GNOME | `/home/ga/.Xauthority` (only if SSH into same session) |
| Direct X session | `/home/ga/.Xauthority` |

**Pattern for all root-context X11 commands:**
```bash
# Always set both DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY explicitly
DISPLAY=:1 XAUTHORITY=/home/ga/.Xauthority xdotool mousemove 500 300 click 1

# Or export at script top
export DISPLAY=:1
export XAUTHORITY=/home/ga/.Xauthority
```

**Also applies to:** `scrot`, `import`, `xwd`, `wmctrl`, `xdotool` — all X11 tools fail silently with wrong XAUTHORITY.

**Affected envs:** Bahmni, FreeCAD, Redmine, GCompris.

---

## 21. Shell Expansion of `$` in Passwords and Hashes

Passwords, bcrypt hashes, and API keys frequently contain `$` characters. Shell double-quotes expand `$var`, silently corrupting the value.

**Common failure:** bcrypt hash `$2y$10$abc...` becomes `$2y0abc...` in double-quoted string.

**Fixes:**
```bash
# Fix 1: Generate hash INSIDE docker exec (no shell expansion)
docker exec app-container php -r '
$hash = password_hash("Admin1234!", PASSWORD_BCRYPT, ["cost" => 12]);
echo $hash;
'

# Fix 2: Single quotes for literal strings
HASH='$2y$10$abc...'  # single quotes = literal, no expansion

# Fix 3: Escape each $ with backslash
HASH="\$2y\$10\$abc..."
```

**Characters that cause issues:** `$`, `` ` ``, `\`, `!` (in some shells).

**Affected envs:** OrangeHRM, GNU Health, any env setting bcrypt/scrypt passwords via shell.

---

## 22. Session Cookies Cannot Be Injected via `cookies.sqlite`

Modern web applications store session cookies in memory, not in `cookies.sqlite`. Modifying the SQLite file while the browser is running has no effect on the live session.

**What doesn't work:**
```python
# This does NOT inject a session into a running browser
conn = sqlite3.connect('~/.mozilla/firefox/profile/cookies.sqlite')
conn.execute("INSERT INTO moz_cookies VALUES (...session_cookie...)")
```

**What works:** Use the browser UI to log in (xdotool automation):
```bash
# Navigate to login page, type credentials, submit
xdotool type --window $WID "$USERNAME"
xdotool key Tab
xdotool type --window $WID "$PASSWORD"
xdotool key Return
```

For repeated logins across tasks, put a `ensure_logged_in()` function in `task_utils.sh` and call it at the start of each pre_task hook.

**Affected envs:** Redmine, VistA VEHU, any env where session-based auth is needed per task.

---

## 23. `pre_start` Timeout — Background Continuation with Marker Files

Some applications require very long installs (15+ minutes). The gym_anything framework has hook timeouts. The pattern to handle this:

**Pattern:**
```bash
# In pre_start.sh — start long install in background, return quickly
install_long_app() {
    # ... 15-minute installation ...
    touch /tmp/install_complete.marker
}

# Start in background, detach from parent
nohup bash -c 'install_long_app' > /tmp/install.log 2>&1 &
echo "Install started in background (PID: $!)"
# pre_start returns immediately — hook doesn't time out
```

```bash
# In post_start.sh — wait for marker before proceeding
echo "Waiting for installation to complete..."
TIMEOUT=900  # 15 minutes
ELAPSED=0
while [ ! -f /tmp/install_complete.marker ]; do
    sleep 10
    ELAPSED=$((ELAPSED + 10))
    if [ $ELAPSED -ge $TIMEOUT ]; then
        echo "ERROR: Installation timed out"
        exit 1
    fi
done
echo "Installation complete, proceeding..."
```

**Affected envs:** GNU Health (15min trytond install), Oracle Database (10min init), Magento.

---

## 24. Subshell Stdout Pollution — Use `>&2` for Status Messages

When capturing output via command substitution (`VAR=$(func)`), **any `echo` inside `func` goes into `VAR`**, not to the terminal. This pollutes the variable with diagnostic text.

**The bug:**
```bash
get_uuid() {
    echo "Calling API..."   # BUG: this goes into UUID variable!
    curl -s http://api/endpoint | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['uuid'])"
}
UUID=$(get_uuid)
# UUID is now "Calling API...\nactual-uuid-value"
```

**The fix:**
```bash
get_uuid() {
    echo "Calling API..." >&2   # Redirect status to stderr (visible on terminal, not captured)
    curl -s http://api/endpoint | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['uuid'])"
}
UUID=$(get_uuid)
# UUID is now "actual-uuid-value" ✓
```

**Rule:** Every function that might be called via `$(...)` must redirect all diagnostic output to `>&2`.

**Affected envs:** OpenMRS O3 (`extract_uuid()`), any env with REST API UUID extraction.

---

## 25. `set -euo pipefail` Breaks `source task_utils.sh`

`set -euo pipefail` is excellent for error detection in standalone scripts, but breaks shared utility sourcing:

- `set -e` exits immediately on any non-zero return, including common patterns in task_utils.sh
- `set -u` fails on unset variables that may be intentionally unset in the shared utility
- If task_utils.sh has any command that returns non-zero (even `grep` finding no match), the entire script exits

**Affected pattern:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail  # BAD for setup_task.sh files
source /workspace/scripts/task_utils.sh  # May exit here if task_utils.sh has any failure
```

**Fix for setup_task.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Do NOT use set -euo pipefail in setup_task.sh files that source shared utils
# Use explicit error handling instead:
source /workspace/scripts/task_utils.sh || { echo "Failed to source task_utils"; exit 1; }
```

**OK to use in:** standalone install scripts (`pre_start.sh`, `post_start.sh`) that don't source shared utilities.

**Affected envs:** Bahmni (explicitly documented), many others.

---

## 26. `unzip` Interactive Prompt Hangs SSH Sessions

`unzip archive.zip` to a directory with existing files prompts interactively:
```
replace existing_file? [y]es, [n]o, [A]ll, [N]one, [r]ename:
```
This blocks the SSH session indefinitely, causing hook timeouts.

**Always use overwrite flag:**
```bash
# Wrong — will hang if target files exist
unzip archive.zip -d /target/dir/

# Right — quiet + overwrite without asking
unzip -qo archive.zip -d /target/dir/

# Alternative: delete target first
rm -rf /target/dir/ && unzip -q archive.zip -d /target/dir/
```

**Related:** Never download multiple zip files to the same directory if their contents overlap (SolveSpace `box-parts.zip` and `box-asm.zip` share files).

---

## 27. Screenshot Tool Selection by Compositor

Different screenshot tools work/fail depending on the display compositor:

| Tool | GNOME compositor | No compositor |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| `scrot` | ❌ Black image | ✓ Works |
| `import -window root` | ❌ Black image | ✓ Works |
| `xwd -id <WID>` | ✓ Works | ✓ Works |
| VNC screenshot (Python) | ✓ Works | ✓ Works |

**Rule for GNOME environments:**
```bash
# Capture a specific window (always reliable)
WID=$(DISPLAY=:1 XAUTHORITY=/home/ga/.Xauthority xdotool search --class Epiphany | tail -1)
DISPLAY=:1 XAUTHORITY=/home/ga/.Xauthority xwd -id $WID -out /tmp/ss.xwd
convert /tmp/ss.xwd /tmp/ss.png

# Or use VNC screenshot (most reliable overall)
# See gym_anything.runtime.runners.vnc_utils.VNCConnection
```

**Affected envs:** Bahmni (xwd required), SolveSpace (import -window root), LibreCAD (import -window root).

---

## 28. Windows: `schtasks /IT` Required for All GUI Apps from SSH

SSH in Windows runs in **Session 0** (the service session). Session 0 has no display. Any GUI app launched from Session 0 creates a window that's invisible to VNC/RDP and to the user.

**This is non-negotiable for ALL Windows GUI environments.**

```powershell
# WRONG — launches in Session 0, no visible window
Start-Process "C:\Program Files\App\app.exe"

# RIGHT — use schtasks with /IT to run in interactive session
$time = (Get-Date).AddMinutes(1).ToString("HH:mm")
schtasks /Create /SC ONCE /IT /TR "C:\path\to\app.exe" /TN "LaunchApp" /ST $time /F
Start-Sleep -Seconds 65
schtasks /Delete /TN "LaunchApp" /F 2>$null
```

**Important subtleties:**
- Always use dynamic `/ST` time: `(Get-Date).AddMinutes(1).ToString("HH:mm")` — never hardcode `/ST 00:00`
- Set `$ErrorActionPreference = "Continue"` before schtasks (strict mode treats stderr as fatal)
- Use `/F` to force overwrite existing task names

**Affected envs:** All Windows environments — Power BI, NinjaTrader, Office 2010, Visual Studio 2022, Copper POS.

---

## 29. Windows Automation: Win32 API Clicks vs PyAutoGUI

Win32 API mouse simulation (`SetCursorPos` + `mouse_event`) does NOT work for all applications. Some apps ignore synthetic input from this method.

**Known non-working apps:** NinjaTrader, Copper POS (NCH Software).

**Fallback: PyAutoGUI TCP server** — deploy a Python socket server on the VM that accepts commands:
```powershell
# In post_start — start PyAutoGUI TCP server on port 5555
python3 -c "
import socket, json, pyautogui
# ... socket server loop receiving {action, x, y} commands
"
```

```python
# In setup_task.ps1 — send commands to PyAutoGUI server
function Send-PyAutoGUI($cmd) {
    $client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient("localhost", 5555)
    # ... send JSON command
}
```

**Decision tree:**
1. Try VNC clicks (simplest)
2. If that fails, try Win32 API (`SetCursorPos` + `mouse_event`)
3. If that fails, use PyAutoGUI TCP server

**Affected envs:** NinjaTrader, Copper POS.

---

## 30. PowerShell Strict Mode + Native Commands

`Set-StrictMode -Version Latest` in PowerShell causes native command stderr output to throw **terminating errors**, even when the command succeeds.

```powershell
Set-StrictMode -Version Latest  # Dangerous with native commands

# This FAILS even though msiexec succeeds (msiexec writes to stderr):
msiexec /qn /i "app.msi"  # → "The term 'NativeCommandError' is not..."
```

**Fixes:**
```powershell
# Fix 1: Suppress stderr for specific commands
msiexec /qn /i "app.msi" 2>$null

# Fix 2: Temporarily lower error preference
$ErrorActionPreference = "Continue"
msiexec /qn /i "app.msi"
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"

# Fix 3: Don't use Set-StrictMode in scripts with native commands
# Use it only in pure PowerShell sections
```

**Affected envs:** All Windows environments using PowerShell install scripts.

---

## 31. Verify DB State After Every Seeding Operation — Never Trust `|| true`

**The problem:** Setup scripts commonly append `|| true` to suppress errors from seed INSERTs. But some databases have NOT NULL columns with no defaults that aren't obvious from documentation. An INSERT silently fails, `|| true` hides the error, and the task starts with wrong initial state.

```bash
# BAD — INSERT fails silently if drugs table has NOT NULL cols with no defaults
oscar_query "INSERT INTO drugs (demographic_no, GN, BN, dosage)
VALUES ('$PATIENT_NO', 'Amiodarone', 'Cordarone', '200mg');" 2>/dev/null || true
# No indication of failure — initial_drug_count recorded as 0 instead of 1
```

**Two root causes to guard against:**
1. **Hidden NOT NULL columns** — run `SHOW CREATE TABLE` or `DESCRIBE` before writing any INSERT to find them
2. **Wrong column names** — DB PKs are not always `id`; never assume — verify with `DESCRIBE tablename`

**Fix — always echo a count verification after seeding:**
```bash
# RIGHT — seed using SELECT FROM to carry existing column values
db_query "INSERT INTO drugs (...)
SELECT d.demographic_no, ..., 0, 0   -- include all NOT NULL cols with safe defaults
FROM patient_table d WHERE d.name='Patient Name';" 2>/dev/null || true

# CRITICAL: immediately verify the INSERT worked
DRUG_COUNT=$(db_query "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM drugs WHERE demographic_no='$PATIENT_NO'")
echo "Seeded drug count: $DRUG_COUNT (expected: 1)"
if [ "${DRUG_COUNT:-0}" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Drug seeding failed — task cannot proceed correctly"
    exit 1
fi
```

**General rule:** After every `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` in setup_task.sh, query the row count and log it. If the expected data isn't there, fail loudly (`exit 1`) rather than silently continuing with corrupt state.

**Affected envs:** OSCAR EMR (`drugs` table has `position INT NOT NULL`, `dispenseInternal TINYINT NOT NULL`), any relational DB environment.

## 32. Verifier Partial-Credit Fallbacks Must Use Deltas Against Baseline, Not Absolute Counts

**The problem:** When setup seeds initial data (e.g., one drug as a precondition), a verifier fallback like `current_count >= 1` fires on do-nothing — because the seeded data already satisfies the condition. This gives a do-nothing agent unearned partial credit.

**Example of the bug:**
```python
# BAD — setup seeds Amiodarone (1 drug); do-nothing gets 10pts because count >= 1
elif result.get('current_active_drugs', 0) >= 1:
    score += 10
    feedback.append("A medication was added but not confirmed by name")
```

**The fix — always compare against the recorded baseline:**
```python
# GOOD — only fires if agent added a NEW drug beyond what was seeded
elif result.get('current_active_drugs', 0) > result.get('initial_drug_count', 0):
    score += 10
    feedback.append("A medication was added but not confirmed by name")
```

**General rule:** Any verifier criterion that uses a count or existence check must be phrased as a **delta** — `current > initial` — whenever setup_task.sh seeds data for that same table/field. The `initial_*` baseline must be:
1. Recorded by setup_task.sh **after** all seeding is complete
2. Written to a temp file (e.g., `/tmp/initial_drug_count_<task>`)
3. Read by export_result.sh and included in the result JSON
4. Used by the verifier as the denominator for all delta comparisons

**This pattern applies to:** medications, allergies, notes, measurements, appointments, attachments, tickets — any entity that setup seeds as a precondition.

**Affected envs:** OSCAR EMR (`medication_review_and_allergy`), any env where setup seeds entities the agent must create/modify.

## 33. Three-Test Verifier Validation (Required Quality Gate)

Every verifier must pass three anti-gaming tests before a task is considered complete. These are **not** about simulating agent behavior — they validate the verifier's own correctness and resistance to gaming.

**The three required tests:**

| Test | Method | Expected result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Do-Nothing** | `env.reset()` + `env.step([], mark_done=True)` | `score == 0` |
| **Wrong-Target** | Inject null/unchanged-baseline result JSON, then call verifier | `score == 0` |
| **Partial Completion** | Inject partial result JSON (only some subtasks done) | `0 < score < pass_threshold` |

**Do-nothing test** — use the framework directly:
```python
env = from_config("benchmarks/cua_world/environments/<env>", task_id="<task>@1")
obs = env.reset(seed=42, use_cache=True, cache_level="post_start", use_savevm=True)
obs, reward, done, info = env.step([], mark_done=True)
result = info.get("verifier", {})
assert result.get("score", -1) == 0, f"Do-nothing gave score={result.get('score')}"
```

**Wrong-target/partial tests** — inject a crafted result JSON file, then call the verifier through `env.step([], mark_done=True)`:
```python
# Since export_result.sh (post_task hook) runs as root, /tmp/task_result.json is owned by root.
# SFTP write from the 'ga' user fails with PermissionError.
# Use sudo python3 stdin injection instead:

def inject_result(ssh_client, task_name, payload):
    json_bytes = json.dumps(payload, indent=2).encode()
    transport = ssh_client.get_transport()
    channel = transport.open_session()
    channel.settimeout(None)
    dest = f"/tmp/{task_name}_result.json"
    channel.exec_command(
        f"sudo python3 -c \"import sys; open('{dest}', 'wb').write(sys.stdin.buffer.read())\""
    )
    channel.sendall(json_bytes)
    channel.shutdown_write()
    channel.recv_exit_status()
    channel.close()
```

**Wrong-target payload design**: simulate the scenario where the agent edits the *wrong* object. Export_result.sh should query by specific name/ID, so the wrong object won't appear — the correct target is simply not found and has null/baseline values. A good wrong-target payload is the same as the do-nothing (unchanged baseline):
```python
WRONG_TARGET = {
    "task": "update_operator",
    "operator": {
        "company_full_name": "CorrectTarget Inc.",
        "operator_type": 0,      # unchanged from baseline
        "authorized_activities": ["photographing"],  # unchanged
    },
    "error": None
}
```

**Partial payload design**: complete only some subtasks (enough to score >0 but not enough to pass):
```python
PARTIAL = {
    "task": "register_aircraft_chain",
    "aircraft_model": {"name": "Nile Scout 200", "category": 2},  # done
    "aircraft_assembly": None,  # NOT done
    "aircraft": None,           # NOT done
    "error": None
}
# Expected: aircraft_model earns partial points; assembly+aircraft give 0 → total below pass threshold
```

**Wrong-target protection in export_result.sh**: The anti-gaming guarantee is only as good as the export script. Export scripts must query by the **expected specific name or ID** hardcoded in the task, not by "most recently created" or "any object of this type". This ensures that editing the wrong object leaves the result at the unchanged baseline.

**Affected envs:** All environments — this is a universal quality gate for every task's verifier.

## 34. Paramiko `exec_command(timeout=N)` Is Per-Read, Not Per-Command

`paramiko.Channel.exec_command()` does **not** accept a `timeout` parameter for total execution time. The `settimeout(N)` on a channel sets the *socket receive timeout* — i.e., how long to wait for the next packet of stdout/stderr. For scripts that run silently (no output) for longer than N seconds, this raises `socket.timeout` (or `paramiko.buffered_pipe.PipeTimeout`) even though the script is still running normally.

**The bug:**
```python
# BUG: setup_task.sh runs silently for 45s, timeout=30 → raises PipeTimeout at ~30s
stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command("sudo bash /workspace/scripts/setup.sh", timeout=30)
stdout.read()  # raises socket.timeout before script finishes
```

**The fix — use a raw channel with `settimeout(None)` and poll for exit status:**
```python
transport = ssh.get_transport()
channel = transport.open_session()
channel.settimeout(None)          # no per-read timeout — block until data arrives
channel.exec_command("sudo bash /workspace/scripts/setup.sh")

# Poll for completion (channel.recv_exit_status() blocks until done)
exit_status = channel.recv_exit_status()
output = b""
while channel.recv_ready():
    output += channel.recv(4096)
channel.close()
```

**Alternative for scripts with output:** If the script produces output, read in a loop:
```python
channel.exec_command("sudo bash /workspace/scripts/setup.sh")
output = b""
while not channel.exit_status_ready():
    if channel.recv_ready():
        output += channel.recv(4096)
    time.sleep(0.1)
output += channel.recv(65536)  # drain remaining
exit_status = channel.recv_exit_status()
```

**Rule:** Never use `exec_command(..., timeout=N)` for scripts expected to run longer than N seconds with no output. Use raw channel with `settimeout(None)` for any setup/export script that could run silently for >30 seconds.

**Affected envs:** Any environment where setup_task.sh or export_result.sh runs a multi-step operation (DB migrations, service restarts, file processing) without producing stdout during execution.
